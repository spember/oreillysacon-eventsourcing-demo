# Event Sourcing Demo

This is a small demo app put together for the inaugural O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference. It's a simple demonstration of
event sourcing within the confines of an ecommerce shopping cart application.

It's one major dependency is the [ThirdChannel Event Source library](https://github.com/RSV2/eventsource), which as of this writing is not maven-accessible yet.

It's very limited, but is designed to give an idea of how interacting with an app might generate and read events.
